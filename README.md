DetectEx is an educational game that teaches the player to use Regular Expressions through a fun puzzle-solving adventure. We integrated an Express server with a PostgreSQL database in order to track user location and send game data based on user progress in realtime. On the front end we used React and Material UI to render the game as a single page web application. Sound, animation and a fun story make for an engaging user experience.
