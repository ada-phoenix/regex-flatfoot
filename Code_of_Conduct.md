## Phoenix Norms

_1) What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?_

##### Each person should make their case for their idea

* Then vote
* If you feel VERY strongly about something, and need another voice, put in a help ticket/ask instructor
* Try and suspend your preconceived notions of what is right and argue for the side you don’t necessarily believe to see if you learn something

_2) What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go._

##### Bears to avoid:

* Lack of communication => Bring it up in standup! “How was yesterday? Did something come up that you want to talk about?”
* Open and honest communication and safe space
* Feeling imbalance in workload => Communication! Workflow planning
* Storage Room Clause : Only quiet work spaces!!!!!!!

_3) What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?_

##### Unless someone reviews the code, we do not merge

* Try for one merge per day, EOD
* When we leave at night, ideally have a master/pull request that can be reviewed in the morning

_4) When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?_

##### 30 Minutes from non-productive struggle point: Ask the rest of the team for help

\*_This is a good time for an ego check! You could solve this yourself, but at what cost?_

* Once the team gets involved, they can decide together how to proceed (help ticket, etc.)
* Especially if this is new code the other team members have not seen--bring someone in!

_5) How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?_

##### Natural stopping points - no gods, no masters, no timers!

* Tell your partner when you need a break, feel fatigued, etc.
* Morning stand-up, talk about what the group did yesterday, what needs to be done today, break up into pair-solo based on that

_6) How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?_

##### Branch any solo work

* Communicate to the rest of the team what you’re working on -- push frequently
* No one should feel pressured to work after hours, but it’s okay as long as you communicate to the rest of the team

_7) What time does this group have daily stand up?_

##### In the morning, after REACTO

## Coding Conventions:

* Commits:
  EX: feat(routes/products): added get all route

- Capitalize Component files and components
- Ternaries are cool!
